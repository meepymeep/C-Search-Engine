The reason this is here, is because when I was working on this project. I had to remove all of the header files and restart, so I kept this here
because this was the most painful thing I coded cause concatenating TWO STRINGS TO ONE STRING IS THE MOST PAINFUL FUCKING THING I'VE DONE IN C, anyway.

void _concat_site_name_com_(char site_name[50], struct site* _site) {
    char* old_site_name = malloc(sizeof(char*));
    char com[6];
    char* https = malloc(sizeof(char*));

    strcpy(https, "https://www.");
    strcpy(old_site_name, site_name);
    strcpy(com, ".com/");

    strcat(https, old_site_name);
    strcat(https, com);

    strcpy(_site -> site_name_com_concat, https);

    /* These free statements avoid memory leaks. */
    free(old_site_name);
    free(https);
}
